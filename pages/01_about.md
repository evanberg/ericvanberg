Hi.

I'm Eric.

I used to develop software, but now I develop teams.

My Resume can be found here: [Resume](http://ericvanberg.com/resume)

Code samples (what few I have) can be found on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/evanberg).

Much thanks to those behind [GitHub-pages](https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/) and the devs behind [jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll).

This is the base Jekyll theme. You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)
